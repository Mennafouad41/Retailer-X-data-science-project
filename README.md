Retailer X is boutique retailer with only one physical location. They believe that their niche in the market is attributable to their unique flair of affordable, everyday items, including health and beauty, electronics, specialty treats, and apparel. 

Their marketing is mostly word-of-mouth and a “surprise value” coupon that is sent to loyalty members, and an occasional coupon that is offered in support of local school fundraising efforts.

The retailer has interest in growing and potentially selling their products through new channels and is looking for some direction for an expansion strategy. They heard about analytics and want to see what it can do for them.

•	They want to know what factors are associated with increased levels of spending in their stores.
